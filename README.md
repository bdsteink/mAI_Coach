# CSIS516
Final Project CSIS516

Project Name:
mAI Coach - AI Personal Trainer

Description:
mAI coach is an application to assist users in maintaining a healthy lifestyle by allowing them to log workouts and using integrated AI coaching to maintain progress and achieve growth.
 
Purpose: 
This application is designed to retrieve information from the user, such as weight, height, age, and workout data from the workout log. AI will use this data to help the user meet goals of losing weight or gaining strength by recommending workout plans.

Value: 
This project allows users to receive workout advice as well as accountability to keep their goals. The value behind this application comes from the simplicity of advice and goal setting. There are many exercise professionals that say different things. mAI Coach can help users remain accountable for their goals and receive fitness advice for improving their health.

Technologies involved: 
Pandas will be used for data keeping and visualizations of workout data. Tkinter will be used to create the User Interface for users to enter their data. I used OpenAI API to implement ChatGPT 4 Turbo into my project. I used PowerShell and command prompt to install necessary packages via pip install. The code retrieves my api key from an env file, by loading the env using the dotenv package. This project also utilizes JSON for user data. I plan to implement matplotlib to incorporate data visualization in my project.
